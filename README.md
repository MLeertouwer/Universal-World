# Universal-World

Universal World started as a school curriculum exercise and has evolved into a personal project where I’m exploring and improving my skills with Laravel, Bootstrap, and database-driven web development.

# About

The project displays information about planets, pulling the data dynamically from a database.

The homepage is styled with Bootstrap and reflects my personal design preferences.

Other pages are still close to the original school assignment and will be updated progressively as I learn more about Bootstrap and Laravel.

# Technologies Used

Laravel (PHP Framework)

Bootstrap (CSS Framework)

MySQL for storing planet data

# Current Status

Homepage: Fully redesigned and styled using Bootstrap.

Other pages: Functional but still based on the initial school assignment layout.

Actively learning Bootstrap and Laravel to improve the design and functionality.

# How to Run Locally

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/MLeertouwer/Universal-World.git

Install dependencies via Composer:

composer install

Set up your .env file with your database credentials.

Run migrations and seeders if applicable:

php artisan migrate --seed

Start the development server:

php artisan serve

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.

# Future Plans

Redesign remaining pages with Bootstrap for a consistent look.

Finish it.
